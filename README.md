# Synapse DCC Utilities

Code for managing data coordinating operations (e.g., development of the CSBC/PS-ON Knowledge Portal and individual Center pages) for Sage-supported communities through Synapse. Currently this package is able to:
* Build tables and charts to summarize annotations from a view
* Build a DCC dashboard to summarize multiple projects
* Provide tools/scripts to handle metadata management (e.g to/from GEO)
* Pull publications from PubMed
* Build projects
* Invite members to a team
